In this project, I created a python script which can fetch all the tweets done by a twitter handle(as many as allowed by twitter api) and dump the responses into JsonLines file.

The other part of my script parse these Jsonlines file to display the following for every tweet.

• The text of the tweet.
• Date and Time of the tweet.
• The number of favorites/likes.
• The number of retweets.
• Number of images present in tweet.
